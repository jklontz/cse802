\maketitle

The objective of this project is to build an effective classifier for a twenty class subset of the ImageNet \cite{imagenet} database.
The proposed classifier will seek to levereage a variety of modern pattern recognition techniques in order to maximize rank 5 accuracy.

Image classification has a rich history as a subject in computer science with many datasets proposed for advancing the state of the art including Caltech 101 \cite{caltech101}, and PASCAL VOC \cite{pascal09}.
